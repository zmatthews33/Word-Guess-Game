# Word-Guess-Game

This is 60's and 70's bands themed Word Guess Game (Hangman) that runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

Press any key to begin guessing.

A band name is generated with _ representing the numbers of letters in the name.

As the user guesses the correct letters, they are revealed in the spaces.

If you miss, the letter is added to the Letters Guessed spot, a new part of the hangman is drawn on the page and the number of guesses displayed goes down by 1.

Game plays a victory sound if you win or a sad noise if you lose and a new word is generated.

Game displays # of Wins and Losses by a user.

Technical Note:

I wrote all of my code inside of the reset().
